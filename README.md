# Snooze Pocket — links for later

Are you an avid user of [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/)? Then you probably have
those dozen links at the bottom of your list that have been there forever!

Maybe it's for a concert that hasn't started selling tickets yet. Maybe it's
stuff to do for when your friend is coming to visit you. Maybe it's stuff about
a new hobby that you don't have the time for right now.

Whatever they are, if those “bottom links” bother you, _Snooze Pocket_ is the
extension for you!

## Privacy

_Snooze Pocket_ respects your privacy! The extension does not collect any data
on you. All of your data stays between you, your Firefox profile, and your
Pocket account.

## Contributions welcome!

I'm developing this extension in my free time. Saying that, please report any
issues and feature requests here on GitHub, or send me pull requests, and I'll
try to get back to you as soon as possible!

Another way to contibute is to help with translations. This just means copying
the [messages.json](src/_locales/en/messages.json) file into another directory
under [src/\_locales](src/_locales) with your language (or language and region)
code. See MDN's documentation on
[Internationalization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Internationalization#Providing_localized_strings_in__locales)
for details.
